# Welcome to Realtime Global Illumination
This is a student project that uses Vulkan with the [Walnut app template](https://github.com/StudioCherno/WalnutAppTemplate) from [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno).

Do check out the [marketAnalysis.md](https://github.com/asyxui/RealtimeGI/blob/master/marketAnalysis.md) for my research around the topic.
## Getting Started
After cloning the project, you can run vulkan/scripts/Setup.bat to generate Visual Studio 2022 solution/project files (Windows only). 
You will find most of my code in [Application.cpp](https://github.com/asyxui/RealtimeGI/blob/master/vulkan/Walnut/Walnut/src/Walnut/Application.cpp).
